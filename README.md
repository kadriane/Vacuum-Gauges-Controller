## General Info

The graduate thesis has been performed in collaboration with the CERN and AGH.

The aims of this master project was to design and prototype the new controller, which will be replaced with the out-of-date and obsoleted controllers (the TPG300 and the VGC1000) still in use at CERN.

Author of project was responsible for:
- designing, prototyping and soldering the motherboard and backplane PCBs,
- designing and prototyping firmware implementation for STM32 main microcontrollers,
- designing and implementing GUI (Graphical User Interface),
- designing and implementing PC console application in C++.

The practical part of this graduate project has been conducted from September 2017 up to September 2018 at CERN. The aims of this thesis were fulfiled successfully and the controller has been psychically made. The VGC prototype is operational and can serve the vacuum gauges such as Helmer, Bayard-Alpert, Pirani, Penning and Piezo-resistive.
